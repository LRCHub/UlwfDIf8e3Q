Be my little baby bumble bee
And bring home all the honey love to me
Let me spend the happy hours
Roving with you 'mongst the flowers
When we get where no one else can see

Be my little baby bumble bee
We'll be just as happy as can be
Honey keep a-buzzin' please
I've got a dozen cousin bees
And I want you to be my baby bumble bee

(Be my little baby bumble bee)
(Bring home all the honey love to me)
(Let me spend the happy hours)
(Roving with you 'mongst the flowers)
(And when we get where no one else can see)

Cuddle up, cuddle up, come and cuddle up
Be my little baby bumble bee
We'll be just as happy as can be
Honey keep a-buzzin' please
I've got a dozen cousin bees
But I want you to be my baby bumble bee
