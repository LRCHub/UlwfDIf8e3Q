Bumble bee, bumble bee
Won't you, please, come back to me?
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Won't you, please, come back to me?
He got the best old stinger
Any bumble bee I ever seen

He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
He had me to the place once
I hate to see my bumble bee leave home

I can't stand to hear him
Buzz, buzz, buzz
Come in, bumble bee
I want you to stop your fuss
You're my bumble bee
And you know your stuff
Oh, sting me, bumble bee
Until I get enough

Mmm, his stinger long as my right arm
Mmm, stinger long as my right arm
He stung me this mornin
I been lookin' for him all day long

Sometimes he makes me happy
Then sometimes he makes me cry
Sometimes he makes me happy
Then sometimes he makes me cry
He had me to the place once
I wish to God that I could die
