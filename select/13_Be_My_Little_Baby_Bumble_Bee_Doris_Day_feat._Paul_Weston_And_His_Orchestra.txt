Buzz around, buzz around,
Buzz around, buzz around, keep a-buzzin' 'round
Be my little baby bumblebee
(Buzz around, buzz around, keep a-buzzin' 'round)

Bring home all the honey, love, to me
(Little bee, little bee, little bumblebee)
Let me spend the happy hours

Roving with you 'mongst the flow'rs
When we get where no one else can see
(Cuddle up, cuddle up, come and cuddle up)

Be my little baby bumblebee
(Buzz around, buzz around, keep a-buzzin' 'round)
We'll be just as happy as can be
(You and me, you and me, you and me)

Honey, keep a-buzzin', please
I've got a dozen cousin bees
And I want you to be my baby bumblebee

Be my little baby bumblebee
Bring home all the honey, love, to me
Let me spend the happy hours
Roving with you 'mongst the flow'rs
And when we get where no one else can see

Cuddle up, cuddle up, come and cuddle up)
Be my little baby bumblebee
(Buzz around, buzz around, keep a-buzzin' 'round)
We'll be just as happy as can be
(You and me, you and me, you and me)

Honey, keep a-buzzin', please
I've got a dozen cousin bees
But I want you to be my baby bumblebee
Buzz-buzz
